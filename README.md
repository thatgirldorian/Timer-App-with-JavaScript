# Timer-App-with-JavaScript

This is an application that allows you to set a timer. It works like a stop watch and can count down from a number of seconds. I created it with vanilla JavaScript.

<h3>Issued faced & resolution</h3>:
I struggled with finding a way to give the circle's stroke attribute a gradient color. However, I was able to resolve this by setting the linearGradient in the *def* attribute like so:

                <defs>
                    <linearGradient id="gradient" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="0%" y2="100%">
                    <stop offset="0%" stop-color="#43919B" />
                    <stop offset="100%" stop-color="#30AADD" />
                    </linearGradient>
                </defs>
